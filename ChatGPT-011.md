JFS Prompt:
What file formats of data can you analyze?

ChatGPT4 Response:
I can analyze data in various file formats commonly used for data storage and analysis. Some of the most common file formats that I can work with include:

CSV (Comma-Separated Values): This is a plain text format where each line represents a row of data, and the values within each line are separated by commas.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that uses a human-readable text format. It is commonly used for storing structured data.

Excel (XLS, XLSX): Microsoft Excel files can contain one or more worksheets with tabular data. Both the older XLS format and the newer XLSX format are supported.

SQL (Structured Query Language): If you have data stored in a relational database, I can help you analyze it using SQL queries. You can provide me with the necessary information to connect to the database.

Text files: If your data is stored in a plain text file with a specific format, such as fixed-width columns or custom delimiters, I can analyze it as well.

These are just a few examples, but I can work with many other file formats as long as the data is structured and accessible.

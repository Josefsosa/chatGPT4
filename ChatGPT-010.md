JFS Prompt:
Can you analyze a data set?  if you can how many rows and how do i get you to load it into memory?

ChatGPT4 Response:
Yes, I can help you analyze a data set. Please provide me with the data set in a format that I can understand. If the data set is small enough, you can directly paste it here. Otherwise, you can upload the file and provide a link to download it. Once I have access to the data, I can load it into memory and perform various analyses based on your requirements.

Please specify the number of rows in the data set and any particular analysis or questions you would like me to explore.
